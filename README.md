# Healthcare Data Analytics Project using PowerBI
### Project Overview
This data analytics project is focused on analyzing bed occupancy and finances within a healthcare company. The primary objective is to assist the organization in optimizing bed occupancy rates and improving its financial performance. The project utilizes four CSV data files, each containing critical information related to bed occupancy, patient billing, discharges, and outpatient visits.<br/><br/>

### Dataset Information
- `Bed Occupancy Report.csv:` Contains records for bed occupancy, including bed category details, total beds, occupancy, vacancy, and more.<br/>

- `Bill Register Report.csv:` Includes patient billing and discount data.<br/>

- `Discharge Report.csv:` Contains information on discharged patients, including gender, class, age, disease, and length of stay.<br/>

- `OP Visit Report.csv:` Contains records of outpatient visits, including patient names, Health IDs, gender, purpose of visit, and consulting doctors.<br/><br/>

### Data Transformation and Analysis
- `Data Transformation:` Leveraged Power Query for data transformation and cleaning to ensure data accuracy.<br/>

- `Data Measures:` Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate various data measures, which served as the foundation for key performance indicators (KPIs).<br/><br/>

### Interactive Power BI Dashboard
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard, incorporating pie charts, bar graphs, and data cards for visually compelling data representation.<br/><br/>
**Generated Insights**<br/>
The dashboard provides valuable insights including:

- `Bed Occupancy Metrics:` Conseus Bed, Average Length of Stay, Occupancy Percentage, and more.<br/>
- `Financial Metrics:` Gross Revenue, Net Revenue, Discounts, Revenue Breakdown by Source (IP, OPD, Pharmacy), and more.<br/>
- `Patient Data:` Discharge Rates, Patient Demographics, and Outpatient Consultations.<br/><br/>

These insights empower the healthcare organization to optimize bed occupancy, streamline finances, and enhance operational efficiency.
